# Web Application changelog

Status — Web Application: **unreleased**.

Every entry states exactly what was verified — a passing automated test does not imply a platform was manually checked, and a manual check on one OS does not imply another. See [Verification levels](/reference/trust/verification-levels) for what each status means.

<a id="lensword-documentation-site"></a>

### Documentation: LensWord has a real documentation site (docs/, built with VitePress), organized around Diátaxis (Setup tutorial, Install how-to guides, Learn explanation, Reference material) — replacing a flat, uncurated docs/ folder.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed; artifact build: passed; manual checks — windows: passed; production observation: not_applicable

Every surface (Web, Desktop, Browser Extension, MCP Server, Local CLI) now has a real, verified guide instead of scattered or missing documentation — including install steps, security/privacy behavior, and an honest account of what has and hasn't been tested for that surface.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

docs/.vitepress/config.mts defines the site; every existing doc was moved (not deleted) into the new structure, apps/browser/README.md and apps/mcp/README.md are pulled in via VitePress's markdown @include feature so they can't drift from source, and a SurfaceChooser Vue component reads docs/internal/product-registry.json directly so the surface-comparison table can't drift from the audit that backs it.

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- GitHub Pages deployment for the site is wired up but not yet enabled (repository Settings -> Pages -> Source is still unset) — the site builds successfully in CI but has no public URL yet.

<a id="lensword-brand-identity"></a>

### Added: LensWord has a canonical logo and icon set for the first time — a favicon in the web app, real desktop app icons, and a real browser extension icon, replacing generic/unbranded placeholders.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed; artifact build: passed

The web app now has a real favicon and social-preview image, the desktop app has a real icon instead of Tauri's default, and the browser extension shows a real icon in the toolbar and extensions page instead of nothing.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

Original SVG mark (lens + word-line) in brand/logo/svg/, with a reproducible generation script (scripts/generate-brand-assets.py) that derives every PNG/WebP/ICO/ICNS raster asset from the vector sources. Wired into apps/frontend's favicon/Open Graph tags, apps/desktop's Tauri icon set (replacing the default Tauri-generated placeholder), and apps/browser's manifest icons/action.default_icon (previously unset — the extension had no working icon at all, since MV3 doesn't accept SVG for that field).

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- Desktop icon change was not visually re-verified on a packaged installer (none has ever been built) — confirmed only that the icon files exist at the correct paths/sizes referenced by tauri.conf.json.

<a id="fix-frontend-api-url-validation"></a>

### Fixed: Fixed a bug where a scheme-less VITE_API_URL silently sent every API request to the wrong place instead of failing clearly.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed; production observation: observed

A misconfigured API URL now fails immediately with a clear error instead of silently sending every request to the wrong place with a confusing 405/404.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

apps/frontend/src/lib/runtimeConfig.ts's browser-path fallback used VITE_API_URL as-is with no validation. A value missing its http(s):// scheme (e.g. "lensword-api.conectlens.com" instead of "https://lensword-api.conectlens.com") doesn't fail the build — every fetch() call silently treats it as a relative path and resolves it against the page's own origin. Caught this exact way in production: real requests going to https://lensword.conectlens.com/lensword-api.conectlens.com/api/v1/... and failing with a confusing 405, with nothing pointing at the actual misconfigured environment variable. Added an explicit check (assertAbsoluteHttpUrl) that throws a specific, actionable error at first use instead.

<a id="fix-desktop-build-and-selfhost-env-gaps"></a>

### Fixed: Fixed a desktop-installer build failure (never previously exercised by a real CI run) and a docker-compose self-hosting gap where Ollama/AI and remote-MCP settings couldn't be configured via .env.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed

A CI-built desktop installer (either release channel) now actually builds instead of failing during the frontend-embedding step. Cloudflare deploy workflows no longer fail on an npm peer-dependency conflict before ever reaching the actual deploy step. docker-compose-based self-hosters can now turn on local AI/Ollama suggestions or the remote MCP transport by setting a value in .env, without editing docker-compose.yml directly.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json's beforeBuildCommand used ../../frontend, which is only correct if Tauri executes it relative to the config file's own directory (src-tauri/). It does not — it executes relative to wherever `tauri build` was invoked from (apps/desktop, per CONTRIBUTING.md's documented flow and this project's own tauri-action projectPath), where the correct relative path is one level up (../frontend), not two. Confirmed both the bug and the fix by actually running `npx @tauri-apps/cli@2 build` locally: before the fix, the documented beforeBuildCommand path resolved to a nonexistent sibling directory outside the repo (`<repo-root>/frontend` instead of `<repo-root>/apps/frontend`) and failed with a misleading "no package-lock.json" error from npm; after the fix, the frontend build step inside `tauri build` completes and the Rust build proceeds. This had never been caught because no tag was ever pushed to trigger release.yml, and the desktop CI job (ci.yml) only runs `cargo check`, which doesn't exercise beforeBuildCommand at all.
Separately, docker-compose.yml's backend service environment: block passed through DATABASE_URL/SECRET_KEY/CORS_ORIGINS/FIRST_ADMIN_* but not AI_PROVIDER/OLLAMA_MODEL/OLLAMA_BASE_URL or REMOTE_MCP_ENABLED/MCP_ISSUER_URL, even though the root .env.example's own header comment claimed "anything set there can also be passed through" — for those specific settings, that claim was false. Added the missing passthroughs (with the same working defaults as apps/backend/.env.example) to docker-compose.yml, and documented them in the root .env.example with a pointer to docs/install/local-ai-ollama.md's Docker-specific OLLAMA_BASE_URL guidance (`localhost` inside the container is not the host machine). Also pinned cloudflare/wrangler-action's wranglerVersion to 4.120.0 in the three deploy-*.yml workflows added in #310 — the action's own default (observed via a real failed CI run: 4.86.0) has a @cloudflare/workers-types peer-dependency conflict with the version this project's package.json already installs (^5.x).

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- The desktop build fix was verified up through the frontend-embedding step (beforeBuildCommand completing successfully); the full native Rust/Tauri compilation and installer packaging was not run to completion in this environment (no signing certificates, and a full release build takes longer than was practical to wait out here) — CI is the real gate for that, and this fix directly addresses the exact failure a real CI run on main just produced.
- docker-compose.yml still doesn't pass through the RATE_LIMIT_* or DB_POOL_SIZE/DB_MAX_OVERFLOW/LOG_LEVEL/DB_ECHO/SCHEDULER_JOB_STORE settings — deliberately scoped to the ones a self-hoster is actually likely to want to change (AI/Ollama, remote MCP), not a full mirror of every backend setting; the root .env.example says so explicitly and points at apps/backend/.env.example for the rest.
