# Changelog

LensWord isn't one product with one changelog — it's five independently distributable surfaces (plus a shared backend that isn't independently released), each with its own release status and verification evidence. Pick a product below for its full history, or read the combined list here.

| Product | Status | Changelog |
|---|---|---|
| Web Application | unreleased | [Web Application changelog](/reference/changelog/web) |
| Desktop Application | unreleased | [Desktop Application changelog](/reference/changelog/desktop) |
| Browser Extension | unreleased | [Browser Extension changelog](/reference/changelog/browser-extension) |
| MCP Server | unreleased | [MCP Server changelog](/reference/changelog/mcp) |
| Local CLI | unreleased | [Local CLI changelog](/reference/changelog/mcp) |

The shared backend (`apps/backend`) is not an independently released product — see [docs/internal/repo-audit.md](https://github.com/conectlens/lensword/blob/development/docs/internal/repo-audit.md). Its changes are folded into whichever product(s) they actually affect, listed below.

## Latest changes, all products

**MCP Server, Local CLI**

<a id="mcp-read-tool-request-id-fix"></a>

### Fixed: Read-only MCP tool calls (e.g. searching your vocabulary) no longer fail with an "unsupported payload field" error.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed

Every read-only MCP tool (search_words, get_due_reviews, get_learning_progress, and others) now works when called through a real MCP client or the stdio protocol directly, instead of failing validation before reaching your account's actual permissions.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

apps/mcp's BackendClient.invoke() unconditionally attaches a request_id to every tool call payload, but contracts.py's payload validator only allowed request_id on write-class tool schemas, so every read-class call made through the stdio MCP server was rejected before it could reach the policy gate. Fixed validate_payload() to always allow request_id, matching the /api/v1/mcp/invoke route handler's own read/write-aware handling of it, which already assumed this was safe.

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- No real MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) was connected interactively to confirm this from a client's perspective — verified directly against the JSON-RPC protocol instead.

**Web Application, Desktop Application, Browser Extension, MCP Server, Local CLI**

<a id="lensword-documentation-site"></a>

### Documentation: LensWord has a real documentation site (docs/, built with VitePress), organized around Diátaxis (Setup tutorial, Install how-to guides, Learn explanation, Reference material) — replacing a flat, uncurated docs/ folder.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed; artifact build: passed; manual checks — windows: passed; production observation: not_applicable

Every surface (Web, Desktop, Browser Extension, MCP Server, Local CLI) now has a real, verified guide instead of scattered or missing documentation — including install steps, security/privacy behavior, and an honest account of what has and hasn't been tested for that surface.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

docs/.vitepress/config.mts defines the site; every existing doc was moved (not deleted) into the new structure, apps/browser/README.md and apps/mcp/README.md are pulled in via VitePress's markdown @include feature so they can't drift from source, and a SurfaceChooser Vue component reads docs/internal/product-registry.json directly so the surface-comparison table can't drift from the audit that backs it.

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- GitHub Pages deployment for the site is wired up but not yet enabled (repository Settings -> Pages -> Source is still unset) — the site builds successfully in CI but has no public URL yet.

**Web Application, Desktop Application, Browser Extension**

<a id="lensword-brand-identity"></a>

### Added: LensWord has a canonical logo and icon set for the first time — a favicon in the web app, real desktop app icons, and a real browser extension icon, replacing generic/unbranded placeholders.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed; artifact build: passed

The web app now has a real favicon and social-preview image, the desktop app has a real icon instead of Tauri's default, and the browser extension shows a real icon in the toolbar and extensions page instead of nothing.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

Original SVG mark (lens + word-line) in brand/logo/svg/, with a reproducible generation script (scripts/generate-brand-assets.py) that derives every PNG/WebP/ICO/ICNS raster asset from the vector sources. Wired into apps/frontend's favicon/Open Graph tags, apps/desktop's Tauri icon set (replacing the default Tauri-generated placeholder), and apps/browser's manifest icons/action.default_icon (previously unset — the extension had no working icon at all, since MV3 doesn't accept SVG for that field).

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- Desktop icon change was not visually re-verified on a packaged installer (none has ever been built) — confirmed only that the icon files exist at the correct paths/sizes referenced by tauri.conf.json.

**Desktop Application, Web Application, Backend (API)**

<a id="fix-desktop-build-and-selfhost-env-gaps"></a>

### Fixed: Fixed a desktop-installer build failure (never previously exercised by a real CI run) and a docker-compose self-hosting gap where Ollama/AI and remote-MCP settings couldn't be configured via .env.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed

A CI-built desktop installer (either release channel) now actually builds instead of failing during the frontend-embedding step. Cloudflare deploy workflows no longer fail on an npm peer-dependency conflict before ever reaching the actual deploy step. docker-compose-based self-hosters can now turn on local AI/Ollama suggestions or the remote MCP transport by setting a value in .env, without editing docker-compose.yml directly.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json's beforeBuildCommand used ../../frontend, which is only correct if Tauri executes it relative to the config file's own directory (src-tauri/). It does not — it executes relative to wherever `tauri build` was invoked from (apps/desktop, per CONTRIBUTING.md's documented flow and this project's own tauri-action projectPath), where the correct relative path is one level up (../frontend), not two. Confirmed both the bug and the fix by actually running `npx @tauri-apps/cli@2 build` locally: before the fix, the documented beforeBuildCommand path resolved to a nonexistent sibling directory outside the repo (`<repo-root>/frontend` instead of `<repo-root>/apps/frontend`) and failed with a misleading "no package-lock.json" error from npm; after the fix, the frontend build step inside `tauri build` completes and the Rust build proceeds. This had never been caught because no tag was ever pushed to trigger release.yml, and the desktop CI job (ci.yml) only runs `cargo check`, which doesn't exercise beforeBuildCommand at all.
Separately, docker-compose.yml's backend service environment: block passed through DATABASE_URL/SECRET_KEY/CORS_ORIGINS/FIRST_ADMIN_* but not AI_PROVIDER/OLLAMA_MODEL/OLLAMA_BASE_URL or REMOTE_MCP_ENABLED/MCP_ISSUER_URL, even though the root .env.example's own header comment claimed "anything set there can also be passed through" — for those specific settings, that claim was false. Added the missing passthroughs (with the same working defaults as apps/backend/.env.example) to docker-compose.yml, and documented them in the root .env.example with a pointer to docs/install/local-ai-ollama.md's Docker-specific OLLAMA_BASE_URL guidance (`localhost` inside the container is not the host machine). Also pinned cloudflare/wrangler-action's wranglerVersion to 4.120.0 in the three deploy-*.yml workflows added in #310 — the action's own default (observed via a real failed CI run: 4.86.0) has a @cloudflare/workers-types peer-dependency conflict with the version this project's package.json already installs (^5.x).

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- The desktop build fix was verified up through the frontend-embedding step (beforeBuildCommand completing successfully); the full native Rust/Tauri compilation and installer packaging was not run to completion in this environment (no signing certificates, and a full release build takes longer than was practical to wait out here) — CI is the real gate for that, and this fix directly addresses the exact failure a real CI run on main just produced.
- docker-compose.yml still doesn't pass through the RATE_LIMIT_* or DB_POOL_SIZE/DB_MAX_OVERFLOW/LOG_LEVEL/DB_ECHO/SCHEDULER_JOB_STORE settings — deliberately scoped to the ones a self-hoster is actually likely to want to change (AI/Ollama, remote MCP), not a full mirror of every backend setting; the root .env.example says so explicitly and points at apps/backend/.env.example for the rest.

**Desktop Application**

<a id="desktop-production-default-and-continuous-release"></a>

### Added: A desktop installer built by CI (either release channel) now defaults to the hosted production API instead of a local loopback address, and a new automatic "continuous build" channel publishes an always-current desktop build on every push to main.

*2026-08-07* — verification: automated tests: passed

A LensWord Desktop installer downloaded from GitHub now works against the real hosted service out of the box, with no configuration step, instead of only working once a local backend is also running. A new "Continuous Build" release (tag desktop-continuous, marked prerelease) reflects the current tip of main and updates automatically; the existing desktop-v* tagged-release channel is unchanged in behavior beyond also getting this same production default.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

apps/desktop/api-config/src/lib.rs's DEFAULT_API_BASE is now resolved via option_env!("LENSWORD_RELEASE_API_BASE") at compile time, falling back to the existing http://127.0.0.1:8000 literal when unset. Only CI release builds set that variable (.github/workflows/build-desktop-installers.yml, a new reusable workflow extracted from release.yml's original single-file form so release.yml and the new release-continuous.yml share identical packaging/signing logic rather than risking drift between two copies). cargo build/cargo tauri dev never set it, so local development is unaffected — verified by running the existing 25-test suite unchanged, then re-running with LENSWORD_RELEASE_API_BASE set and confirming the one test that hardcodes the loopback literal fails for exactly the expected reason (the compiled constant genuinely changed). The runtime LENSWORD_API_URL env var and api-endpoint config file both still outrank the compiled-in default either way, so a downloaded installer remains fully self-hostable. release-continuous.yml triggers on push to main (path-filtered to apps/desktop and apps/frontend), deletes and recreates a rolling `desktop-continuous` GitHub prerelease each time via `gh release delete` before invoking the shared reusable workflow — chosen specifically to avoid depending on unverified behavior of tauri-action's own handling of re-publishing to an already-existing tag.

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- Not verified end to end against a real deploy — the production API (lensword-api.conectlens.com) this defaults to did not exist as a live service when this was written (see the Cloudflare deployment PR); a downloaded installer using the new default won't actually reach a server until that's deployed.
- release-continuous.yml itself has not run for real (no push to main happened from this session) — the reusable workflow it calls is verified only by inspection and by the fact that release.yml's unchanged packaging/signing steps already work; the new delete-then-recreate rolling-release step is untested against a live GitHub Releases API.

**Browser Extension**

<a id="browser-notification-icon-fix"></a>

### Fixed: Capture notifications ("Saved to LensWord", error notifications) now show the LensWord icon instead of a broken image.

*2026-08-07* — verification: not verified

Every capture notification (success or failure) now renders with a real icon instead of a missing-image placeholder.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

service-worker.js's three chrome.notifications.create() calls referenced iconUrl: 'icon.svg'. Chrome's notifications API does not support SVG icons (confirmed against Chrome's own extension documentation and a matching real-world "Unable to download all specified images" bug report). Fixed to reference icons/icon48.png, the PNG icon set added by the brand-assets work.

</details>

**Known limitations:**
- Not confirmed by loading the extension into a real Chrome instance and observing a live notification — chrome:// pages could not be driven by this documentation session's browser automation. Fix is based on Chrome's documented SVG limitation plus a matching reported failure, not a directly observed broken/fixed notification.
